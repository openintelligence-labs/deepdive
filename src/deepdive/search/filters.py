"""Source-restriction filter: allow/block lists of hostnames.

Wraps any search backend and discards results whose URL doesn't match the
caller's policy. Domain matching is hostname-based with bare-suffix and
wildcard support:

    "pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"  matches that exact host
    "ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"         matches host AND any subdomain
    "*.gov"                    matches any host whose suffix ends in .gov
    "gov"                      same as "*.gov" (bare TLD)

To keep N results after aggressive filtering, the wrapper over-fetches by a
configurable factor and stops once the cap is reached.

DeepDive ships the *mechanism* — no opinionated bundled lists. Bring your own
allow/block sets via the CLI flags ``--allow-domains`` / ``--block-domains``.
